1. Project description (Django IMS – “StockMaster”)

Goal:
Replace Excel sheets and manual registers with a centralized, role-based Inventory Management System where:

Inventory Managers control receipts, deliveries, stock adjustments and reports.

Warehouse Staff perform day-to-day operations: picking, packing, transfers, counting.

The system keeps a real-time stock ledger per product & location and provides a dashboard with KPIs and alerts (low stock, pending operations, etc.).

Technology: Django, Django auth, possibly Django REST Framework later if you want APIs.

2. Core feature list
A. Authentication & User Roles

User sign-up / login with Django auth.

Role flags: is_inventory_manager, is_warehouse_staff (or use Django Groups).

OTP-based forgot password / reset (via email or SMS API).

After login → redirect to Dashboard.

B. Dashboard (Landing / Home page)

When user logs in, they see:

Top KPI cards (as in your wireframe):

Total Products in Stock

Count of active products that have stock > 0 across all locations.

Low Stock Items

Count of products below their min_qty (from Reorder Rule).

Out of Stock Items

Count of products whose available quantity = 0.

Pending Receipts

Number of RECEIPT operations with statuses: WAITING or READY.

Pending Deliveries

Number of DELIVERY operations with statuses: WAITING or READY.

Internal Transfers Scheduled

INTERNAL operations not yet DONE or CANCELED.

Central table: “Recent Operations / Stock Moves”

Columns (matches your wireframe idea):

Reference / Document No.

Type (Receipt / Delivery / Internal / Adjustment)

Source Location

Destination Location

Status (Draft, Waiting, Ready, Done, Canceled)

Scheduled Date

Last Updated

Dynamic filters above the table:

By document type (multi-select or dropdown).
